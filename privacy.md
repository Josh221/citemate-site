# Privacy Policy for CiteMate

_Last updated: July 24, 2025_

CiteMate is a Chrome extension designed to help users generate citations from webpages in various referencing styles. We value your privacy and aim to be as transparent as possible about how data is handled.

## Information We Collect

CiteMate **does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information**. The extension operates entirely within your browser and only interacts with the content of the webpage you choose to cite.

Specifically:
- No user data is transmitted to external servers.
- No personal identifiers (such as name, email, IP address) are collected.
- No browsing history is accessed or stored.

## Permissions Explanation

CiteMate requests the following permissions:

- **activeTab**: Allows the extension to temporarily access the currently active tab when you click the extension. This is necessary to extract page metadata (e.g., title, author, URL) in order to generate a citation.
- **scripting**: Enables the extension to inject scripts into the current webpage to extract citation information dynamically.
- **clipboardWrite**: Used to automatically copy the generated citation to your clipboard for convenience.

These permissions are used **only when you interact with the extension**, and only for the purpose of generating and copying a citation.

## Data Security

Since CiteMate does not collect or store any data, there is no risk of personal information being exposed, sold, or shared.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the "Last updated" date will be revised accordingly.

## Contact

If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, feel free to reach out via the GitHub repository or through the contact information provided on the extensionâ€™s listing.
